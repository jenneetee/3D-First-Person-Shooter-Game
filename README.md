# 3D-First-Person-Shooter-Game
A first-person shooter game that I made for my Game Development I class.

Features in the game include:
* Weapon switching using the "Q" key
* NPCs that patrol a certain area using Unity's game AI
* Sound and visual effects using the particle system
* Bullets and Health system
