This project represents a first-person shooter game developed as part of my Game Development I class. The game showcases the following features:

* Weapon Switching: Switch between weapons using the "Q" key.
* AI-Powered NPCs: Implementing Unity's game AI, the game features NPCs patrolling designated areas
* Audio and Visual Effects: Enhanced the gaming atmosphere with sound and visual effects using Unity's particle system.
* Bullets and Health System: Keeps track of how many lives and bullets the player has left.
